        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <p>Three weeks into the education I learned how to make a website responsive.
            The assignment was to build a responsive website of a given style (Flat design in my case). The website must contain a page with information and images of that style, a page about myself and a page showing the overall process of creating the website, f.x. color scheme, typograohy, images, sketches, logos, icons and folder-file structure.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="page2">
        <h2>Focus</h2>
        <p>This assignment was focusing on almost every single thing I had learned this far. Testing methods and design principles, sketching, writing and designing wireframes, colour schemes, mood boards and style tiles. Valid HTML and CSS code using Brackets, editing and exporting images using Adobe Photoshop, making icons and logos using Adobe Illustrator and prototyping UI using Adobe XD.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="page3">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>Coming in with a little bit of a background in coding HTML and CSS was very good, but the amount of objectives I learned and only the first few weeks is insane. I knew how to do things, but now I know why I do them. Coding became much easier and fun, the steps we take before making a final version/product are crucial and also getting feedback from diverse group of people.</p>
        <p> Breakpoints using @media queries, positioning items and content on the website using grid and making a burger menu are the three things on the top of my mind that I take from this assignment.</p>
