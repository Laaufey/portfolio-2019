        <h2>Focus</h2>
        <p>In teams of two, we chose to make a game called the fly game. When we made the game we chose to use my adorable illustration drawing of my cat, found some cat sounds, and called the game Catch the Cat. After making the game I attached it to my page I made the week before with the javascript animations. I added the button "game" where it can be played.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>My part of the assignment was making the mood board and the storyboard, drawing the characters for the game(5). Making a front page, a sprite animation, gif, javascript for the stars on front page and in the end all of the team put everything together and made sure it was going good. Me and Astrid made a facebook page and put in our gif advertisement. </p>

    <div id="page31">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>I found myself in a well put together group where we had different talents. The flow was well organised and everybody had their role. I found that Kanban chart is very useful and helpful and the storyboard is a key. I got a bit more insights into javascript and cpuld understand the game code more than I thought I would.</p>
